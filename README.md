# mfg-hub

## Note
This project is prototype/proof-of-concept.  Not sure if I will maintain it or what direction it will go in.

## Purpose
Tools for computing mfg costs and materials.   

Currently:  
1.  Can accurately compute a `build of materials` or BOM for recipe (aka basic standard frame s and its dependencies).
